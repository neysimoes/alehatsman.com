For more than 7 years I have been working professionally as a Software Engineer. During this time I put together a nice developer setup. This article is my attempt to review it, improve it and share it with others.

Most of the time I spend in **command line**, writing code in **Vim**, executing commands in **Zsh** shell, switching panes and sessions in **Tmux**  and all that is rendered in **Alacritty** terminal emulator running on my Mac.

What my developer environment consists of?

* MacOS as main operation system
* Ansible for installation and configuration
* Alacritty as a terminal emulator
* ZSH as command interpreter (shell)
* Tmux as a terminal multiplexer (sessions, panes)
* Nvim as the main text editor

## Table of Contents

## Structure of Command line

Most of the time I spend in command line, reading and writing code in `Nvim`, jumpling between different windows in `Tmux` and running commands in `Zsh` and all that is rendered in `Alacritty` terminal emulator.

### Shell 

`Shell` is a program which takes text commands, parses it, executes and prints back result. Here I am refering to CLI shell. Shell defines syntax and concepts of the scripting language that you can input in. Different shells have different rules. Examples: `Bash`, `Zsh`, `Fish`.

### Terminal

`Terminal` is a program which runs your shell of choice and renders GUI window where you can interact with your CLI shell. Examples: `iTerm2`, `Alacritty`, `Kitty`. Some terminals provide you with features like multiple windows, tabs, splits etc.

### Terminal Multiplexer

`Terminal Multiplexer` is a program which orchestrates multiple terminal sessions into single terminal window. It is command line window manager, where windows are terminals, each terminal can have multiple windows and windows can be splitted into panes.

## Alacritty

<img src="/static/images/developer_enviroment_productivity/alacritty.svg" height="100px" />

In the beginning I was using terminal just as window where I execute simple commands to run tests or commit something. For quite a while I was fun of terminals that are integrated into your editor. Some forces were attracted me into world of text based apps and instead of having terminal in the Editor, I started having Editor in my terminal.

When you havily use command line, espessially when you search, move around, or write code in Nvim - you expect you terminal to render text fast. At some point I was frustrated with performance of my terminal and found a solution - [Alacritty][alacritty link].

Alacritty is just a very fast windows with shell running inside. It is written in Rust and uses GPU acceleration for rendering. There are no GUI features like windows, tabs or splits.

### Installation

```yml
---
- name: Make sure alacritty is present
  homebrew_cask:
    name: alacritty
    state: present

- name: Make sure config directory is present
  file:
    path: ~/.config/alacritty
    state: directory

- name: Make sure config file is present
  template:
    src: templates/alacritty.yml.j2
    dest: ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml
```

### Configuration

Alacritty is configured using configured using global text file located in `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`

Next line have to be configured for correct colors rendering:

```yml
env:
  TERM: xterm-256color
```

I'm using it with `Fira Code` font, but it doesn't support font ligatures.

```yml
font:
  normal:
    family: Fira Code
    style: Regular
  bold:
    family: Fira Code
    style: Bold
  italic:
    family: Fira Code
    style: Italic
  size: 14.0
```

Setup default shell - `Zsh`

```yml
shell:
  program: /usr/local/bin/zsh
  args:
    - --login
```

### Key bindings

In order to be able to use to use `^`, when you type `<ctrl>6`, in Nvim to switch between files, I had to configure Alacritty to send `\x1e` hexcode.

```yml
key_bindings:
  - {key: Key6, mods: Control, chars: "\x1e"}
```

Full Alacritty configuration is here [.alacritty.yml](https://github.com/atsman/env-automation/blob/master/roles/alacritty/templates/alacritty.yml.j2)

## Tmux

<img src="/static/images/developer_enviroment_productivity/tmux_logo.svg" height="100px" />

[Tmux][tmux link] is a terminal multiplexer which allows to have multiple sessions, windows and splits in one terminal window. Command line window manager.

* **sessions**: list of terminals, each has one or more windows
* **window**: window takes one screen and can be splitted into panes
* **pane**: smallest part of the window

Usually I have session per project open and multiple windows in each session. For example I can have session `work`, with 2 windows open, one for code in Nvim and one window for running build scripts and tests.

Tmux allows to quickly navigate between sessions, windows and panes. With some additional configuration I was able to get Vim key bindings to be used for jumping between splits, browsing logs and copy-pasting text.

### Plugins

[Tmux Plugin Manager (tmp)][tmp link] is used to simplify plugins management. It simplifies installation process and management of plugins.

It has to be cloned to `~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`.

```tmux
# predefined settings
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'

# copy to system clipboard
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'

# regex search
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat'

# open highlighted selection
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-open'
```

### Colors problem

At some moment I noticed that Nvim colors when it is opened in Tmux are different comparing to Nvim opened outside of Tmux control, to fix that:

```
# fix terminal colors
# set -g default-terminal screen-256color
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color" # colors!
# tell Tmux that outside terminal supports true color
set -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color*:Tc"
```

### Vim-like copy paste

```
# starts selection mode
bind C-[ copy-mode
bind -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send -X begin-selection

# copy with 'enter' or 'y' and send to mac os clipboard: http://goo.gl/2Bfn8
unbind -T copy-mode-vi Enter
bind -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"

# paste
bind p paste-buffer

# paste from system clipboard MacOS
bind C-v run \"tmux set-buffer \"$(reattach-to-user-namespace pbpaste)\"; tmux paste-buffer"
```

### Vim-like pane navigation

To be able to navigate between panes using Vim key-bindings, just install next plugin:

```
set -g @plugin 'christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator'
```


To be able to use navigation in fzf window, fzf needs to be added to is_vim check.

```
is_vim="ps -o state= -o comm= -t '#{pane_tty}' \
    | grep -iqE '^[^TXZ ]+ +(\\S+\\/)?g?(view|fzf|n?vim?x?)(diff)?$'"
bind-key -n 'C-h' if-shell "$is_vim" 'send-keys C-h'  'select-pane -L'
bind-key -n 'C-j' if-shell "$is_vim" 'send-keys C-j'  'select-pane -D'
bind-key -n 'C-k' if-shell "$is_vim" 'send-keys C-k'  'select-pane -U'
bind-key -n 'C-l' if-shell "$is_vim" 'send-keys C-l'  'select-pane -R'
tmux_version='$(tmux -V | sed -En "s/^tmux ([0-9]+(.[0-9]+)?).*/\1/p")'
if-shell -b '[ "$(echo "$tmux_version < 3.0" | bc)" = 1 ]' \
    "bind-key -n 'C-\\' if-shell \"$is_vim\" 'send-keys C-\\'  'select-pane -l'"
if-shell -b '[ "$(echo "$tmux_version >= 3.0" | bc)" = 1 ]' \
    "bind-key -n 'C-\\' if-shell \"$is_vim\" 'send-keys C-\\\\'  'select-pane -l'"

bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-h' select-pane -L
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-j' select-pane -D
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-k' select-pane -U
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-l' select-pane -R
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'C-\' select-pane -l
```

### Shortcuts

Most of the shortcuts have a prefix key as part of them. My prefix is `<ctrl>a`. For example to create new window `<prefix> c`, I have to hold `<ctrl>a` + `c`. 

```
<c-a> - Prefix
<prefix>r - reload config
```

#### Sessions

```
<prefix>:new -s <session-name> - creates new session
<prefix>s - open session list
<prefix>w - open session list with tabs
```

#### Windows 

```
<prefix>c - create new window
<prefix>h - toggle window line
<prefix>1 - go to window 1
<prefix>2 - go to window 2
.
<prefix><N> - go to window N
```

#### Splits

```
<prefix>| - vertical split
<prefix>- - horizontal split
```

#### Navigation

```
<ctrl>h - go to left split
<ctrl>l - go to right split
<ctrl>k - go to top split
<ctrl>j - go to bottom split
```

#### Copy mode

```
<prefix><c-]> - activate copy mode
v - start copy selection
y - copy selection
p - paste selection
```

## Nvim 

<img src="/static/images/developer_enviroment_productivity/nvim_logo.svg" height="100px" />

> [Nvim][neovim link] - a community-driven, refactored version of vim.

Nvim allows me to edit text faster than anything else. It designed to keep hands always in an optimum position to input text, to scroll, to navigate or to apply commands.

Config files are here: [.nvimrc](https://github.com/atsman/env-automation/tree/master/roles/nvim/templates)

### Contents

* [Plugin manager](#plugins-1)
* [File explorer](#file-explorer)
* [Tabs / Splits / Status line](#tabs--splits-and-status-line)
* [Navigation / Search](#navigation--search)
* [Autocomplete](#autocomplete)
* [Linting / Formatting](#linting--formatting)
* [Git](#git)

### Plugins

[Vim-plug][vimplug link] is used to simplify plugin management. It supports on-demand plugin loading for start time fast, and parallel installation / updates.

### File explorer

The [Nerdtree][nerdtree link] presents filesystem in the form of the tree and allows to browse, navigate and manipulate files and directories using Nvim navigation shortcuts.

```
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
```

Configuration:

```
let NERDTreeShowHidden=1 " show hidden files
let g:NERDTreeAutoDeleteBuffer = 1 " delete buffer when delete file
```

Shortcuts:

While buffer is in focus:
```
<leader>fe - toggle file tree
<leader>ff - find current file
```

While the file tree is in focus:
```
t - open file in new tab
i - open file in a hsplit
s - open file in a vsplit
o / enter - open file in the main buffer
```

### Tabs / Splits and Status line

Vim-airline is plugin which draws editor status in a bottom line. It shows current vim mode, current git branch, position of the cursor relative to the beginning of the file.

```
Plug 'bling/vim-airline'
```

In addition it can be used to make tabs nice:

```
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#fnamemod = ':t'
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#tab_min_count = 2
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#show_buffers = 0
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#tab_nr_type = 1
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#tabs_label = ''
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#show_splits = 0
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#show_tab_count = 0
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#show_close_button = 0
```

Tabs mappings:

```
<leader>tt - new tab
<leader>tp - go to prev tab
<leader>tn - go to next tab
<leader>to - close all tabs expect current one

<leader>1 - go to 1 tab
<leader>2 - go to 2 tab
.
<leader>n - go to nth tab
<leader>0 - go to last tab
```

Splits mappings:

```
<c-h> - go to left split
<c-j> - go to bottom split
<c-k> - go to top split
<c-l> - go to left split
<c-\> - go between split
<c-w>o - close all splits except focused one
```

### Navigation / Search

Search and navigation is done via [fzf][fzf link]. It is a generic command-line fuzzy finder. It can be used to search in any list: files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits. From the shell it is used to execute commands from command history, to select git branches, to choose npm scripts and so on.

From inside of the editor it is used via [fzf.vim][fzf vim link] to search for files by filename and to quickly jump between buffers. To search by files content, fzf is used in conjunction with [ripgrep][ripgrep link], which is grep rewritten in rust.

```
Plug '/usr/local/opt/fzf'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

Shortcuts:

```
<ctrl>p - search files by filename
<ctrl>f - search files by content
<ctrl>b - search buffers by filename
```

### Autocomplete

Having editor to predict what are you going to type is must have nowadays. So far the expirience with autocompletion I had with [YouCompleteMe][ycm link].

### Linting / Formatting

```
Plug 'w0rp/ale'
```

While writing code automatic formating and linting is must-have. The best vim plugin for that is [Ale][ale link]. It provides integration with most linting, formating tools and to LSP servers. 

Reasons to use it:

* async execution of linters / fixers
* list of integrations is huge

Shortcuts:

```
<leader>al - lint
<leader>af - fix
<leader>ad - error details
```

### Git

Git integration is done by next plugins:

```
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive' " git commands
Plug 'junegunn/gv.vim' " git commit browser
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter' " git diff sign
```

* [Fugitive][vim fugitive link] - git wrapper, provides all git commands as nvim commands and more.
* [Gv][gv link] - git commit browser, allows to view huge history line and jump between commits.
* [Gitgutter][vim gitgutter link] - shows git diff sign for current file, makes it easy to understand whats changed.

Shortcuts:
```
<leader>gpr - git pull -r
<leader>gc - git commit
<leader>gp - git push
<leader>gb - git blame
<leader>gl - git log
<leader>gd - git diff in vertical split
```

## Zsh

ZSH - highly customizable shell, supports aliases, completions, custom color scheme.

### Plugins

[zplug][zplug link] - plugin manager used to simplify plugin management. Can manage all types of plugins (git, oh-my-zsh, gist files), parallel installation, lazy loading.

### Vim keybindings

```
zplug "plugins/vi-mode", from:oh-my-zsh
```
[vi-mode]() - adds vim keybindings to shell. While you edit text you can exit insert mode and go to command mode where it is possible to navigate and change text the same way like in Vim.

### History substring search

```
zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search
```

Allows to search for command based based on typed part. Next bindings are used `j` `k` to cycle through matches.

```
bindkey '^[[A' history-substring-search-up
bindkey '^[[B' history-substring-search-down
bindkey -M vicmd 'k' history-substring-search-up
bindkey -M vicmd 'j' history-substring-search-down
```

### History fuzzy search

```
zplug "plugins/fzf", from:oh-my-zsh
```

Plugin allows to quickly search in command history using fuzzy search. 

`<ctrl><space>` opens fzf fuzzy search with full history.

### Fish like autosuggestions

```
zplug "zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions"
```

While you type, plugin shows autosuggestion under cursor in gray color based on your history.

### Completitions library

```
zplug "zsh-users/zsh-completions"
```

While you type and hit `<tab>`, plugins shows possible suggestions for command if it is present in completition library.
